### Deployed Application
* [The Nomad Bookshelf](https://nomadbooks.herokuapp.com/)

### Unresolved Issues
* Profile updating and password change systems are non-functional.
* The select box in the /author/edit form only displays the authors already attributed to that book, instead of the full list.

### Potential Future Additions
* A button which allows the user to alternate between a Light and Dark colour theme for the site.
* A method for multiple users to submit a review to any book, instead of the current system where only one review can be assigned upon a book's entry into the database.
* A more creative layout for the Bookshelf and Lookup by Author pages might be considered eventually.
* A way to restrict the books displayed on the "Recently Added" index to only display a recently added selection, instead of the current display of all books in the DB.
